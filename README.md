# Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this project, I wanted to create a weather dashboard that allows me to view the weather in a certain city. Additionally, add the 5 day forecast with some basic icons of the weather.

## Learning Points
Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve weather data for cities.
